## Cations
- Metals form cations and non metals form anions
- Most common cations for metals in the s and p blocks of the periodic table generally one with an $\color{#7B85E3} np^6$ configuration
- Transition metals have partially filled d subshells, but ionization begins with loss of electrons from the s subshell
## Anions 
- Nonmetals have negative electron affinities and form anions with an $\color{#7B85E3} np^6$ electron configuration
- The amount of energy released when atoms acquire additional electrons tends to increase from left to right across the periodic table
- All the halogens form a singly charged (1-) anions, resulting in a $\color{#7B85E3} np^6$ electron configurations
- Formation of isolated ions does not constitute an ionic bond

## Ionic Formations
- Requires energy to form pair
- Ionization energies = +
- Electron Affinities for non-metals are negative
- E input not offset by energy released due to anion formation
- Once formed the force of attraction between the ions significantly lowers their overall energy
	- ### Coulomb's Law
		- $F$ is force of attraction, $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ are the charges, and $r$ is the distance between the nuclei of the two ions
$$\color{#7B85E3}F \propto \frac{q_{1}\ q_{2}}{r^2}$$

- The Potential energy, V, for the ion pair can be calculated as follows:
$$\color{#7B85E3}V = k\ \frac{q_{1}\ q_{2}}{r}$$
- Here $\pu{ k = 1.389E5 kJ pm/mol }$

- Bond Energy
	- Energy released when atoms form a covalent bond
- Bond Length
	-  Distance Between Nuclei in bonded atoms
	
- Formation of chemical bonds always releases energy
	- Once a bond is formed, the same amount of energy is needed to break the bond
	- energy needed varies by atoms involved
- Chemical reactions involve rearranging bonds, transforming reactants into products
	- Reaction is favored is energy needed to break bonds < energy released making product bonds

## Octet Rule
- *An atom will form covalent bonds to achieve a complement of eight valence electrons*
- *The valence shell electronic configuration id $ns^{2}np^{6}$ for a total of eight electrons*
- *For the $n=1$ valence shell, hydrogen is an exception to the octet rule and shares only two electrons*

## Lewis Structure
- Lewis dot symbols keep track of valence electrons, especially for compounds of main group elements, allowing prediction of bonding in molecules
	- To draw a Lewis dot symbol, the valence electrons are represented by dots and are placed around the element symbol
		- The first four dots are placed singly
		- Starting with the fifth dot, they are paired
		- The Lewis symbols for the second period are shown below

# Electronegativity and Bond Polarity
*Electronegativity is the Attraction of an atom for the shared electrons in a covalent bond*

## Resonance Structures
*Resonance Structures can be drawn when the choice of multiple bond location is arbitrary*
- The positions of all atoms are identical; only the positions of the electrons are different
- The actual structure is a resonance hybrid, an average of the contributing structures, and not a mixture of them
