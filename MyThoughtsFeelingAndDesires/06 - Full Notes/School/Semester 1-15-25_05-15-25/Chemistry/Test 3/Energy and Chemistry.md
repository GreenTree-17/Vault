# Energy
- *Potential energy*: Associated with relative position of an object
- *Kinetic energy*: Associated with motion
$$\text{Kinetic Energy} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

- *Joule, J*, is the SI unit of energy
	- $\pu{1 Joule = 1 kg \frac{m^2}{s^2}}$

$$W = \text{mass }\times \text{ acceleration } \times \text{distance}=\pu{ kg \times \frac {m}{s^2} \times m }$$

1 *Btu* is the required energy to raise the temperature of $\pu{1 lb}$ of water by ${1\textdegree{F  } }$
- 1 Btu = 1055 J
 1 *Calorie* is the energy required to raise the temperature of $\pu{ 1 g }$ of water from 14.5 to $15.5\textdegree{ C }$
- 1 calorie = 4.184 J
Energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only change its form.
$$\Delta E=q + w$$
$$\Delta E=E_{\text{final}}- E_{initial}$$Ex. 
#### If 515  J of heat is added to a gas that does 218 J of work as a result, what is the change in the energy of the system?

# Heat Capacity
- Specific heat capacity describes the amount of heat needed to raise the temp of 1 gram of a substance by $1\textdegree{ C }$
	- represented by c
	- specific heat is compound and phase specific
- Molar heat capacity describes the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one mole of a substance by $1\textdegree{C}$
	- Represented by $C_P$
		- the subscript p indicates constant pressure
	- Molar heat capacity is compound and phase specific

$$\begin{align}
q =mc\Delta T\\
q=nC_{p}\Delta T
\end{align}$$

Ex. 
##### Heating a 24.0-g aluminum can raise its temperature by $15.0\textdegree{C}$. Find the value of $q$ for the can.
