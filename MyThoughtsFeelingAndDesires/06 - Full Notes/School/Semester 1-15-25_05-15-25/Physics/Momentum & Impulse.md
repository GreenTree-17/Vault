## Newtons Second Law
$$\sum\vec{F}=m\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}(m\vec{v})$$
Newton's Second law says that the sum of the external force acting on a particle equals the equals the rate of change of the particle's mass and velocity. This is Call momentum or$\vec{p}$
Such that 
$$ \sum \vec{F}=\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}$$
$$\vec{p}=m\vec{v}
$$
**Momentum** Is a vector quantity with the same direction as the particles direction.

## Impulse-Momentum Theorem
The **impulse** acting on an object is **equal** to its **change** in **momentum**.
$$\begin{align} \\
      \vec{J}=\sum \vec{F}(t_{2}-t_{1})=\sum \vec{F}\Delta t \\
 \\
      J = \Delta p = p_{1}-p_{2}
\end{align}

# Example 1
*Two mice are in motion. Treating both mice as one system find the total momentum of the system.*
$$\pu{m_{1} = 2.0 kg\\     \vec{v_{1}} = v_{1x}\hat{x} + v_{1y}\hat{y} = 5m/s\\ \hat{x} \\  - 6m/s\\  \hat{y}}$$
$$\pu{ m_{2}  =  1.5 kg\\       \vec{v_{2}}=v_{2x}\hat{x}+v_{2y}\hat{y} = 4  m/s  + 2  m/s }$$

# Example 2
**A $\pu{2.0 kg}$ ball bounces off a wall.
just before it hits the wall it is travelling horizontally to the right at $\pu{ 4.0 m/s  \hat{x}}$.(When no kinetic energy is lost, we call it an elastic equation.) The collision takes 0.04 s.
a) Find the impulse of the wall on the ball.
b) what is the average force of the wall on the ball?**

# Example 3
*The $2.0kg$ ball bounces off the wall again. This time, just before it hits, it is travelling at $\pu{ 4.0m/s }$ to the right, at $30\textdegree{  }$ below the horizontal. Just after the bounce it is traveling at $\pu{ 4.0m/s }$ to the left, at $30\textdegree{}$ below the horizontal. Find the impulse of the wall on the ball.

# Example 4 
*The $\pu{ 2kg }$ ball bounces off the wall again. This time, just before it hits, it is traveling at $\pu{4.0m/s}$ to the right. Just after the bounce, it is traveling at $\pu{2.0 m/s}$ to the left. (When energy is lost, the collision is considered to be inelastic.) Find the impulse of the wall on the ball.*

## Conservation of Momentum
##### If there are no external forces on a system, then momentum is conserved.
$$
\begin{align}
\text{If  }  \vec{F_{net}} = 0 \\
\vec{P_{tot,i}} = \vec{P_{tot,f}} \\
\end{align}
$$

# Example 5
*Space gal is stranded in space. During a spacewalk, her tether came undone. She is currently at rest (with respect to her ship.) How can she make it back?
Given $\pu{ m_{1} = 100 kg, m2 = 5kg}$.*
###### Solution: 
####### *If she throws her wrench to the right. The equal and opposite impulse (force x time) pushes her to the left. Since this force is internal to the system, the center of mass of the system($m_{1}$and $m_{2}$) does not change. But both masses will be moving.*

*After the wrench leaves Space gal's hand, it is moving at a constant velocity of $\pu{ 18 m/s }$ to the right. Find the velocity of Space gal after the throw.*

## Collisions
Conservation of Momentum is always true in a collision

#### Inelastic Collision:
Energy is not conserved

#### Elastic Collision:
Energy is Conserved


# Example 6
*Two elephants on carts collide. Given the before and after information, find the final velocity of the second elephant. Given: $\pu{ m_{1} = 2.0kg,  m_{2} = 5.0kg }$.
Before $\pu{ v_{1i} = +4.0m/s,  v_{2i} = -6.0m/s}$ After $\pu{ v_{1f} = -6.0m/s }$
Find $v_{2f}$ and the energy lost in the collsion.*
