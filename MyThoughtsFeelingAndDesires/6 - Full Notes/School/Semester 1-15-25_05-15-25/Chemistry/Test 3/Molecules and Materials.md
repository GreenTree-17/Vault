## Phase diagrams
- maps showing which state or phase of a compound or an element will be most stable at a given combination of pressure and temperature
	- The state or phase of a compound can be manipulated by changing the temperature and pressure of the compound

# Condensed Phases
- Atoms arrange themselves into two types of solids
	- *Crystalline Solids*: Atoms that assume a regular, repeating geometric arrangement
	- *Amorphous Solids*: Atoms that assume a random arrangement

# Packing Efficiency Calculations
- To determine the number of complete atoms per unit cell
$$fcc=\frac{1}{2}(\text{\# face-center atoms}) + \frac{1}{8}(\text{\# corner atoms}) = 4$$
$$bcc = (\text{\# body-center atoms})+ \frac{1}{8}(\text{\# corner atoms}) = 2$$
$$sc = \frac{1}{8}(\text{\# corner atoms}) = 1$$

- *To  find the total volume occupied by atoms:*
	- *r is the radius*
$$\text{total volume occupied by atoms = \# atoms in unit cell} * \left( \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \right)$$

- *To find the volume of the unit cell in terms of radius:*
$$V = a^3 \text{ (Where a is the edge length of the unit cell)}$$
$$a_{fcc}=(2\sqrt{ 2 }) r,\;\;\; a_{bcc}= \frac{4}{\sqrt{3 }}r,\;\;\; a_{sc}=2r$$
- *To calculate packing efficiency:*
$$\text{Packing Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Volume of Atoms in Unit Cell}}{\text{Total Volume of Unit Cell}} \times 100 $$

## Coordination Number
- *Number of atoms immediately adjacent to any given atom*
	- Simple cubic structure has a coordination number of 6
	- Body-Centered cubic structure has a coordination number of 8
	- Close-Packed structures, ccp and hcp, have coordination numbers of 12
